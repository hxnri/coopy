## ECE 5725: Embedded OS || Spring 2019 || Cornell University

Final project designed and built by Henri Clarke (@hxnri) and Michael Rivera (@MGRiv).

Coopy is a Raspberry Pi-based robot equipped with facial recognition, bluetooth/WiFi communication, a live camera feed, a remote control GUI, and other fun functions!
