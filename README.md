# LGBT 2290, Spring 2019
## Final project: [Breaking Binaries](breakingbinaries.com)

A website intending to educate people on the gender and sex binary, nonbinary and intersex identities, and the history and effects of both. Breaking Binaries hopes to help friends, loved ones, and caregivers of nonbinary and intersex people understand their identities and be able to respectfully interact them and hopefully mitigate the negative consequences of societal expectations.
